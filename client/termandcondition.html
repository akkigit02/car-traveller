                <li>The voucher is mandatory to avail any applicable discounts (or) in the case of a cashback. In case of a cash back, the amount will be credited to your credit card/debit card account from which the payment was made to DDDCABS.COM. in approximately 15 days from the journey date.</li>
                <li>Any form of discounts is only applicable only on the basic fare and cannot be made available on extra charges like toll, taxes, charges on for extra Kms consumed if applicable, charges for extra hours consumed if applicable, driver allowance, parking, night charges, unless specified.</li>
                <li>The vehicle booked will be subject to availability. In a case where the car booked is not available on the day of travel the customer will be provided with an alternative equivalent vehicle in the similar segment as applicable.</li>
                <li>Transfer and local car rental services are valid only within city limits. For the above mentioned car rental services any request for out station travel beyond city limits will entitle the driver to deny services without any liability to refund the booking amount.</li>
                <li>Customer can request for amendments to a booking made earlier by him only if the request is done 24 hours before the pickup time. No changes will be done before 04 hours of the time of pick up time. In cases where amendments are requested on cab type, the cab type requested is subject to availability. In case of a no show where the customer has not informed DDDCABS on the changes on his schedule 04 hours before the pick up no refunds will be made. The amendments can be done by contacting the support team of DDDCABS on +91 9090404005 and mention the booking confirmation number (Booking ID).</li>
                <li>Customer is liable to pay waiting charges in the case of delay (be it for any reason) exceeding more than 10 minutes from the scheduled pick up time.</li>
                <li>Customer is liable to pay for any additional distance travelled and also for additional hourly charges if applicable. Any unscheduled changes will attract additional charges as applicable.</li>
                <li>All bookings under consideration are on a calendar day basis i.e. from midnight 12:00 to midnight 12:00. As an example, for a cab booked for 1st Jan where the pickup time is 5:00 pm, the booking will be valid till 1st Jan 11:59 pm. and not 2nd Jan 5:00 pm.</li>
                <li>Cabs those are booked for Round Trip (any or all of One-Way, round trip & multicity) cannot be used for local travel. As an example if a customer books a cab from Mumbai to Pune then to Satara and back to Mumbai for a period of 3 days in total & has a predefined Km limit of 750 Kms and he returns back to Mumbai on the second day & has a balance Kms limit of 50 with one day remaining, despite of this he is not entitled to consume this 50Kms for local travel in Mumbai (Source city), however the customer can travel from Mumbai to some other city outside city limits of Mumbai (say Lonavala) & consume the remaining 50 Kms or more than this by paying additional charges.</li>
                <li>One-way car rental services have all travel charges like toll, taxes etc. applicable when the vehicle returns back to its original location (garage) after dropping the customer to his destination. As example if a customer avails one-way car rental service from Mumbai to Pune, he will have to pay all charges applicable while the vehicle returns back from Pune to Mumbai.</li>
                <li>If needed, a customer can amend his booking from one way to round trip or from one way to multi city while his/her travel is in progress. A request for amendment while mentioning the Booking ID & reason for amendment has to be made to the support team at DDDCABS by reaching them on +91 9090404005 Whether or not to make an amendment as per the request of the customer solely rests with our support team. If the amendment request by the customer is approved our support team will guide on the difference amount to be paid to the driver to confirm the amendment. This amount has to be paid immediately to the driver in cash after our team makes an amendment, failure to do so will not make the requested amendment a reality.</li>
                <li>The driver will wait for the customer on the travel date for not more than 30 minutes from his pickup time in a case the customer does not inform the driver on the delay. After 30 minutes the booking will be considered as a case of no show and full booking amount will be forfeited.</li>
                <li>For all travel types (one-way, round trip & local) customer has to bear all extra charges like driver allowance, toll, taxes, charges on for extra Kms consumed if applicable, charges for extra hours consumed if applicable, parking charges, night charges and any other charges applicable as mentioned on the voucher.</li>
                <li>For one way Round Trip trips the customer will pay for any additional charges in the case where the driver needs to cover additional distance (or) needs additional duration to complete his return journey (whichever of these two higher).</li>
                <li>Transfers with unspecified distance coverage will only include one-way transfer either from airport or railway station to a single location or vice versa. Pick-ups or drops from multiple locations are not included in such bookings.</li>
                <li>Cumulative amount of monetary discount shown on our website is only for indicative purpose. The exact discount amount or savings offered depends on the service type.</li>
                <li>DDDCABS cannot be hold accountable for any delay or consequential loss caused to the customer due to traffic jam or reasons beyond reasonable control of the driver or lapses on the part of the driver.</li>
                <li>DDDCABS cannot be hold accountable for any loss, damage, physical injury etc suffered by the customer while availing its services.</li>
                <li>In case of any misconduct t or misbehaviour by the driver the customer should immediately report to the support team of DDDCABS at +91 9090404005 and share the experience while mentioning the booking confirmation number (Booking ID).</li>
                <li>DDDCABS cannot be hold accountable for any loss, damage or delay suffered by the customer due to force majeure events.</li>
                <li>In no event the entire liability of DDDCABS for any loss or damage arising due to cab services or in the case of a valid refund claim shall not exceed the booking amount paid by the customer.</li>
                <li>In case of any dispute parties agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of courts of Thane Maharashtra.</li>
                <li>In addition to all the above-mentioned terms & conditions, user terms mentioned on the website apply.</li>
